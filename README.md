# Countdown Timer with Pause

This Python script allows you to create a countdown timer with a pause feature using the `datetime` module. You can specify the duration of the timer in hours, minutes, and seconds, and control the timer using the keyboard. The timer can be paused and resumed by pressing the 'p' and 's' keys, respectively.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required Python modules: `datetime`, `time`, `keyboard`

## Usage

1. Run the script in a Python environment.
2. Enter the duration of the timer by providing the number of hours, minutes, and seconds when prompted.
3. The timer will start counting down immediately.
4. Press the 'p' key to pause the timer.
5. Press the 's' key to resume the timer.
6. The remaining time will be displayed continuously until the timer reaches the specified duration.

## Example

$ python countdown_timer.py <br>
Enter Hours: 0 <br>
Enter Minutes: 1 <br>
Enter Seconds: 30 <br>
Remaining Time: 0:01:30 <br>
Remaining Time: 0:01:29 <br>
